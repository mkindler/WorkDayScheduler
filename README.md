# WorkDayScheduler

## Description

This project utilizes dynamically updated `HTML` and `CSS` powered by `jQuery` to create a basic calendar application that allows an employee to save events for each hour of the workday.  In addition to `jQuery`, `Moment.js` is used to display and work with date and time.

## Task

The calendar application must display and perform the following:
* Current day and date
* Time blocks for a standard business day, designated as 9AM - 5PM
* Color-coded time blocks to indicate whether the time is in the past, present, or future
* Clickable and editable time blocks for entering event information
* Ability to save entered information in local storage
* Displayed event information upon webpage refresh

## Usage

This application can be used by employees who would like a basic way to digitally schedule their workday on a daily basis.  <i>For the simplicity of this project, the use of local storage is acceptable, but another method would likely be best for storing any data in case of sensitive information.</i>
